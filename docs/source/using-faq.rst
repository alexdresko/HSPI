Using a different IP address and/or port
----------------------------------------

By default, the console will always connect to 127.0.0.1 port 10400. There is no need to specify any command line arguments for that to work.

However, you can specify a custom server and port in "Debug > Start Options > Command line arguments"...

And, of course, you can do the same thing at the command line:
