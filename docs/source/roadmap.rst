Roadmap
=======

I love when a software project has a good roadmap. 

Unfortunately, I've never built a cool roadmap. :) 

In no particular order, and without attaching a date to anything (estimates suck), here are some long term goals for HSPI:

* It would be cool if HomeSeer would officially declared HSPI to be the preferred HomeSeer developer toolkit. Even better if they contributed to HSPI instead of their current process which basically involves updating a zip file of VB.NET examples.
